                  In Thailand there are a few lab test centers that the government accepts results from. Central Laboratory of Thailand is one of these labs and is where we 
                  have our botanicals tested. The testing methods are done with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). This method, validation, and analysis is one of 
                  the most widely used techniques for testing in formulations and biological fluids. Also, this method is the most widely used in testing botanicals in 
                  the United States. We do not test our botanicals in house as to avoid any possible questions of unethical practices, and to align with the Thai government 
                  with accredited and accepted lab results.
